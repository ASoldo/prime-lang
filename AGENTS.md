- No unwinding/exception model—Result/? is the path; embedded panics abort.
- Limited standard library/FFI story; interacting with C/OS or richer collections is still thin.
- Async lacks cancellation/timeouts built-in; everything is manual (poll + recv_timeout).
- Tooling/tests: we should add a host parity test for the new no_std probes to lock in behavior.
